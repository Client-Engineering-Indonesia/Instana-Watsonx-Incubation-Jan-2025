1. To access the Instana interface, click this link: https://ibmdemo-instanaibm.instana.io/. The website will display an interface such as:

2. Hover your mouse to the left. Here are the available menus. We will observe Web & Application, Infrastructure, and Kubernetes step by step.

3. First, we are going to observe infrastructure. Click infrastructure on the menu. We can see the Instana interface. 
Here is the infrastructure that we are going to monitor.

4. You'll notice that there is a box surrounding the "towers" with the zone names that have been configured in the Agent configurations. The box is a "zone".
A zone name was specified during the install of the Instana Agent or added to the Instana Agent configuration file. 
If you hover to one of the infrastructur, we can get detail of the infra such as OS, CPU, Memory, etc

5. In a large environment, finding a specific server or zone can be challenging. Fortunately, the Infrastructure view provides multiple ways to search and organize.

Use the icons in the bottom-right corner to explore filtering and organization options.
Use the Lucene query language in the search bar at the top.
To search using Lucene:
- Hover over a tower to identify a hostname, e.g., mqace.
- In the filter bar, select "Entity," then choose "Host," and then "Name."
- Enter a wildcard search, e.g., entity.host.name:*mqace*, to filter the view.
- This will narrow the Infrastructure view to the matching server.

6. You can also compare infrastructures by clicking the comparison table. Additionally, you can monitor and check health by:

7. Filter the metric you would like to monitor by
