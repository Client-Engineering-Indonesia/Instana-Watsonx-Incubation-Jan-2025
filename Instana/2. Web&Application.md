3. On the dependencies tab, you'll see a full topology of the application services. This topology is discovered automatically. You can see transactions flowing between the different nodes in the topology. Most of these services are node.js based cloud-native services. There should be also be a node with a name that ends in BK1:EG2. BK1 is the ACE Integration Node and EG2 is the ACE Integration Server. The QM1 node in the topology is the MQ Queue Manager named "QM1".

6. Click on the "Analyze Calls" button to analyze the individual transactions that are executing within the "qotd-engraving" service. This will take you to a screen showing all of the different types of calls taking place within the qotd-engraving service. At the top, there is a summary of all calls in terms of transaction rates, return codes, erroneous calls, and latency.

7. On the right side, click the arrow to expand the list of qotd-engraving "POST /order" calls. Instana is capturing 100% of the transactions so that you don't miss intermittent problems that might be occurring in the environment.

8. Select one of the requests. You are now looking at the tracing data for a single transaction. At the top of the screen, you will see a summary of the latency, sub-calls and timeline. On the right side of the screen, you'll see the details and stack trace

9.If you select the text on the left or the timeline bar, the "Details & Stack Trace" context to the right of the page will change. Explore the different types of calls going through this transaction by selecting the individual call. When you select an entry, examine the detailed information on the right.
You should notice that different request types are color coded differently. Blue represents the HTTP requests going through an App Server or java process. Orange represents a database call. And green represents a messaging call (ACE and MQ).
